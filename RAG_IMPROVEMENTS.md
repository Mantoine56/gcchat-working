# RAG Improvements Implementation

This document outlines the improvements made to the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system in the GC Chat application.

## Key Improvements

### 1. LangChain Integration

We've integrated LangChain to provide more sophisticated RAG capabilities:

- **Vector Search**: Using FAISS indices for efficient semantic search
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time token streaming for better user experience
- **Flexible Dataset Support**: Easy switching between different knowledge bases
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: System falls back to traditional methods if LangChain fails

### 2. New Components

The following new components were added to support these improvements:

- **`services/langchain.ts`**: Core LangChain integration for RAG capabilities
- **`app/api/chat/streaming/route.ts`**: Streaming API endpoint
- **`hooks/useStreamingChat.ts`**: React hook for client-side streaming
- **`services/dataset-query.ts`**: Dataset-specific query processing

### 3. Dataset Processing

Scripts to process and prepare datasets for RAG:

- **`scripts/process_pses_data.py`**: Full PSES dataset processor
- **`scripts/process_pses_sample.py`**: Smaller sample processor for testing

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow

1. User sends a message via the chat interface
2. The message is enhanced with dataset-specific context using LangChain
3. Streaming responses begin immediately while the full response is being generated
4. The UI updates in real-time as tokens arrive

### Technical Components

#### LangChain Service

```typescript
// services/langchain.ts
export async function queryWithLangChain(query: string, dataset: DatasetType = 'travel') {
  // Uses FAISS vector stores with OpenAI embeddings
  // Provides retrieval-based context enhancement
}

export async function streamingQuery(query: string, dataset: DatasetType = 'travel') {
  // Returns a stream of tokens for real-time responses
}
```

#### Streaming API

```typescript
// app/api/chat/streaming/route.ts
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  // Streams tokens as they're generated by the model
  // Supports both travel and PSES datasets
}
```

#### React Streaming Hook

```typescript
// hooks/useStreamingChat.ts
export function useStreamingChat(): StreamingChatResult {
  // Provides state management for streaming
  // Handles real-time updates to the UI
}
```

## Usage

### Dataset Switching

The application supports switching between different datasets:

- **Travel Data**: Information about government travel records
- **PSES Data**: Public Service Employee Survey results

Users can switch datasets using the selector in the header. The system automatically uses the appropriate context and instructions for each dataset.

### Streaming Responses

Responses now stream in real-time, providing a more responsive experience. This is particularly valuable for longer responses from the PSES dataset.

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for future enhancement:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimize vector search for larger datasets
2. **Additional Datasets**: Integrate more Government of Canada datasets
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Add metadata filtering capabilities to refine search results
4. **Response Citation**: Link responses back to specific source documents

## Developer Notes

- OpenAI API key must be set in `.env.local` file
- FAISS indices are stored in `data/{dataset}/faiss_index` directories
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server after processing datasets
- All components include detailed comments for easier maintenance
