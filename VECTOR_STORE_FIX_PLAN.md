# Vector Store Compatibility Fix Plan

## Problem Statement

We're encountering compatibility issues with native dependencies (`faiss-node` and `hnswlib-node`) when trying to load Python-generated FAISS indices in our JavaScript environment. This is preventing the PSES dataset from functioning correctly in our RAG application.

## Current Data Structure

From our analysis, we have:
- `index.faiss`: 3MB FAISS index file generated by Python
- `metadata.jsonl`: 209KB file with document metadata in JSON lines format
- `vectors.npy`: 3MB file with embeddings in NumPy binary format
- `raw_texts.jsonl`: 3.3GB file with original text content

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Pure JavaScript Vector Store Implementation

1. **Create a similarity utility**
   - Implement a cosine similarity function in JavaScript
   - Add dot product and other similarity metrics

2. **Create a custom vector store service**
   - Create basic vector store class that reads metadata directly
   - Implement a function to convert `vectors.npy` to JSON or directly read the binary format
   - Add vector search functionality with various similarity metrics
   - Ensure compatibility with LangChain's retriever interface

3. **Update LangChain integration**
   - Modify the code to use our custom vector store
   - Retain fallback mechanisms for error handling
   - Ensure consistent API for both datasets

### Phase 2: Modify the Search Pipeline

1. **Update dataset query service**
   - Add support for our custom vector store
   - Keep existing code paths for travel data

2. **Enhance error handling and logging**
   - Add detailed logging for vector store operations
   - Implement graceful failure modes with user-friendly messages

### Phase 3: Testing and Refinement

1. **Test with sample queries**
   - Validate search results for accuracy
   - Compare performance with original implementation

2. **Optimize performance**
   - Add caching for frequently used vectors
   - Consider batch processing for multiple queries

3. **Document the implementation**
   - Update RAG_IMPROVEMENTS.md with new approach
   - Add code comments for maintainability

## Success Criteria

1. Chat interface successfully retrieves relevant context from PSES dataset
2. No errors or crashes during vector search operations
3. Reasonable search performance and response times
4. Graceful fallbacks if vector operations fail

## Timeline

1. Phase 1: 30 minutes
2. Phase 2: 15 minutes
3. Phase 3: 15 minutes

Total implementation time: Approximately 1 hour
